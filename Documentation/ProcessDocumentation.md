## 16 April 2025 - The beginning
***
It all started with a late night rush of desperation to come with ideas to present for a meeting with advisors that prompted me to begin furiously scribbling down the first things in my head.

## 17 April 2025 - Brainstorming

I was very hung up on the idea of creating a rhythm game for this project as the idea of player actions being controlled by rhythm fits within the idea of outmersion and can be considered a mechanical fourth wall break due to it controlling the player's physical actions. After a discussion with my first advisor, a rhythm game requires a solid game mechanics that takes a good chunk of time to build and is not particularly easy. A prototype has to be done in a span of at least 1 week or 2 first before considering diving deep into developing the idea.

## 21 April 2025 - Then there was light

As I was brainstorming ideas for the game I came upon a particular game on steam and was mesmerised by the sheer ingenius in implementing the ideas of puppetry within the puzzle game. [A Fisherman's Tale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/559330/A_Fishermans_Tale/) was incredibly intriguing and I adored the way the game looks and plays with its mindbreaking puzzle concepts similar to the Puppetry idea I previously had in my scribbles. Having a model of the room and character smaller than the player as well as a larger version compared to the player. While simulatneously creating puzzles that requires the usage of those different models to proceed forward in the game.
