## 16 April 2025 - The beginning

It all started with a late night rush of desperation to come with ideas to present for a meeting with advisors that prompted me to begin furiously scribbling down the first things in my head.

## 17 April 2025 - Brainstorming

I was very hung up on the idea of creating a rhythm game for this project as the idea of player actions being controlled by rhythm fits within the idea of outmersion and can be considered a mechanical fourth wall break due to it having the ability to distate the player's physical actions. After a discussion with my first advisor, a rhythm game requires a solid game mechanics that takes a good chunk of time to build and is not particularly easy. A prototype has to be done in a span of at least 1 week or 2 first before considering diving deep into developing the idea.

This sounds rather daunting, but I do enjoy the idea of working on a rhythm game as it has been on my bucket list for awhile and I never got to fulfil it as of yet. But perhaps it would be wiser to start of with an overarching theme and manifesto that I can always refer back to when designing the game so I don't get lost in the chaos of my own mind.

## 21 April 2025 - Then there was light

As I was lazing about enjoying the Easter weekend, I came upon a particular game on steam and was mesmerised by the sheer ingenius in implementing the ideas of puppetry within the puzzle game. [A Fisherman's Tale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/559330/A_Fishermans_Tale/) was incredibly intriguing and I adored the way the game looks and plays with its mindbreaking puzzle concepts, reminding me of the Puppetry idea I previously had in my scribbles (but cooler and better). Having a model of the room and character smaller than the player as well as a larger version compared to the player. While simulatneously creating puzzles that requires the usage of those different models to proceed forward in the game.

## 24 April 2025 - Getting down to business

The most difficult part is to start, so instead of thinking up the full details of the game plan, I decided to just take the leap and make something for the coming Playtest Evening next Tuesday. 

I decided to try recreating A Fisherman's Tale's and started out with a basic first person perspective animated player controller where you can see your own body. After trying to recreate the large, medium and small version of the player, I realised that it's incredibly tricky to match up the movement for each version and the scaling has to be very accurate in terms of space and movement velocity across the different scales to make it work correcty. No wonder the VR game restricted the player's movement by making them jump from fix positions to another fix position to overcome that movement and placement matchup.
